This is my first refinerycms instance. 

It was created on my client, an older pc running ubuntu 10.10

I used ubuntu 10.10 because I found directions on the internet for deploying ruby 1.92 with rails 3 when I failed to do so in other linux Operating Systems which I prefer.

I used a methodology which used rvm which created a list of dependencies which I installed as well.

I also installed imagemagick because the directions for installing refinerycms included that.

I don't think any of that is in the application instance of refinerycms that gets uploaded.

I have to hope that its already installed or that there is a way to configure the server to run this application.
  
The goal is to make this application work at engineyard and perhaps heroku or another server.
